# Fuzzy Erosion Risk Assessment 
This repository contains a simple expert system that estimates the susceptibility of land to soil erosion using fuzzy logic. The system outputs a qualitative risk level (Low, Medium, High), making it an interpretable and flexible tool for demonstrating fuzzy expert systems in environmental risk analysis.
